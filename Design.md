# **Design Document**

## **Project Goal**

Build a secure, scalable, and user-friendly mental health mobile app (iOS and Android) that provides personalized audio tracks based on user surveys and emotional states. The app will support multi-language functionality from the outset.

---

## **Technology Stack**

### **Frontend**
- Expo (managed workflow)
- React Native
- TypeScript
- NativeBase (UI Library)
- Expo Router (Navigation)

### **Backend**
- Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)

### **State Management**
- Zustand (for onboarding and app state)
- Context API (for authentication state)

---

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Secure User Authentication and Onboarding**

#### **Step 1: Authentication Setup**
- Implement Firebase Authentication with email/password.
- Create an `AuthProvider` context for managing authentication state.
- Secure routes based on authentication status.
- Implement sign-up, sign-in, and password reset flows.
- Add input validation for email and password fields with clear error messages.
- Include social login options (e.g., Google) for faster account creation.

#### **Step 2: User Onboarding**
- Design a multi-step onboarding questionnaire with a progress indicator.
- Implement survey flow using Zustand for state management.
- Store user preferences and responses in Firestore.
- Allow users to skip questions or save progress to resume later.

---

### **Phase 2: Core Features**

#### **Step 3: Home Screen**
- Display personalized recommendations based on onboarding responses.
- Show weekly progress with a radar chart.
- Include a "Next Session" button for quick access to the next audio track.
- Add mood tracking functionality with an option to log daily emotions.
- Display "Recently Played" sessions with scrollable navigation.

#### **Step 4: Explore Section**
- Create a categorized view of meditation sessions (e.g., Stress Relief, Focus).
- Implement search and filtering options for sessions.
- Display metadata like session difficulty levels, duration, and descriptions.

#### **Step 5: Audio Integration**
- Set up Firebase Storage for audio files with secure access.
- Implement audio streaming using Expo's `expo-av` library.
  - Enable background playback and offline access for downloaded content.
  - Add playback controls (play/pause, skip, rewind) with a sleep timer feature.

#### **Step 6: Progress Tracking**
- Store session completion data in Firestore.
- Track meditation minutes and mood patterns over time.
- Visualize progress using charts or graphs (e.g., weekly meditation minutes).

### **Phase 3: User Experience**

#### **Step 7: Multi-Language Support**
- Use `expo-localization` to detect the user's device language automatically.
- Manage translations with `i18n-js` and provide fallback to English if no translation is available.
- Include a language selection option in the profile settings or during onboarding.

#### **Step 8: Personalization**
- Allow users to favorite sessions for quick access later.
- Create custom meditation plans based on user preferences.

## **Screen-Specific Details**

### **Survey Page**
1. Ask users questions about their emotional states and reactions to specific scenarios.
2. Include multiple-choice options with visual elements like icons or emojis to make the survey engaging.
3. Show progress indicators (e.g., "Step 2 of 5") at the top of the screen.

---

### **Register Page**
1. Provide fields for email, password, and confirm password with validation feedback.
2. Add password strength indicators for better security awareness.
3. Include social login options prominently (e.g., Google).

---

### **Login Page**
1. Greet users with a friendly message like "Welcome back! You've been missed."
2. Pre-fill email if the user has logged in previously on the same device.

---

### **Home Screen**
1. Display weekly progress at the top using a radar chart visualization.
2. Include actionable buttons:
   - *Next Session*: Navigates to the audio player page for the next session in the user's plan.
   - *Talk About Your Mood*: Opens the emotion-tracking screen where users can log their feelings.
   - *Keep Introducing Yourself*: Redirects to incomplete survey questions if applicable.

3. Show "Recently Played" sessions as a scrollable list.

---

### **Player Page**
1. Provide playback controls (play/pause, skip, rewind).
2. Add calming visualizations or animations during playback for better engagement.
3. Include a sleep timer feature so users can set an automatic stop time.

---

### **Emotion Screen**
1. Allow users to select up to three emotional statuses from a scrollable list of predefined emotions grouped into categories (e.g., Positive, Neutral, Negative).
2. Highlight selected emotions visually by enlarging text or adding color markers.

---

### **Profile Page**
1. Display user information such as name, email, total meditation minutes, session count, and streaks.
2. Include options to:
   - Change language preferences dynamically.
   - Mute notifications or manage subscription details.

---

## **Technical Considerations**

### **Security**
1. Use Firebase security rules to restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles/authentication state.

### **Performance**
1. Optimize audio streaming using adaptive bitrate techniques for varying network conditions.
2. Preload assets like images and audio files during idle times using Expo's `Asset` module.

### **Scalability**
1. Design Firestore collections efficiently by grouping user-specific data into subcollections (e.g., `/users/{userId}/sessions`).
2. Use Firebase indexes for faster querying of large datasets.

### **Testing**
1. Write unit tests for core functionality like authentication flows and survey logic.
2. Conduct end-to-end tests for critical user journeys like onboarding → home → playback.

### **Monitoring**
1. Integrate Firebase Crashlytics for real-time error reporting.
2. Use Firebase Performance Monitoring to analyze app startup time and network latency.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

1. Guided breathing exercises with visual timers.
2. Group meditation sessions for real-time community engagement.
3. Integration with Apple Health/Google Fit for syncing meditation data.
4. Advanced analytics dashboards showing detailed mood trends over time.
