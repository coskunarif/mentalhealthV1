**Project Goal:**

Build a secure, scalable, and user-friendly mental health mobile app (iOS and Android) that provides personalized audio tracks based on user surveys and emotional states.

**Technology Stack:**

* Frontend:
  * Expo (managed workflow)
  * React Native
  * TypeScript
  * NativeBase (UI Library)
  * Expo Router (Navigation)
* Backend:
  * Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)
* State Management:
  * Zustand (for onboarding and app state)
  * Context API (for authentication state)

**Implementation Plan:**

**Phase 1: Secure User Authentication and Onboarding**

* **Step 1: Authentication Setup**
  * Implement Firebase Authentication with email/password
  * Create AuthProvider context for managing auth state
  * Secure routes based on authentication status
  * Implement sign-up, sign-in, and password reset flows

* **Step 2: User Onboarding**
  * Design multi-step onboarding questionnaire
  * Implement survey flow using Zustand for state management
  * Store user preferences and responses in Firestore
  * Track onboarding progress and allow resume

**Phase 2: Core Features**

* **Step 3: Home Screen**
  * Display personalized recommendations
  * Show daily progress and streaks
  * Implement quick-access to favorite sessions
  * Add mood tracking functionality

* **Step 4: Explore Section**
  * Create categorized view of meditation sessions
  * Implement search and filtering
  * Add session difficulty levels
  * Display session duration and descriptions

* **Step 5: Audio Integration**
  * Set up Firebase Storage for audio files
  * Implement secure audio streaming
  * Add playback controls
  * Enable background audio playback
  * Support offline access to downloaded content

* **Step 6: Progress Tracking**
  * Store session completion data
  * Track meditation minutes
  * Record mood patterns
  * Generate progress insights

**Phase 3: User Experience**

* **Step 7: Personalization**
  * Implement adaptive recommendations
  * Add favorite sessions functionality
  * Create custom meditation plans
  * Support user preferences

* **Step 8: Social Features**
  * Add optional community features
  * Implement streak sharing
  * Create achievement system
  * Add friend invites

**Technical Considerations:**

  * Implement proper Firebase security rules
  * Secure user data and preferences
  * Handle authentication edge cases
  * Protect audio content access

* **Performance:**
  * Optimize audio streaming
  * Implement efficient data caching
  * Minimize app bundle size
  * Handle offline scenarios

* **Scalability:**
  * Structure Firestore collections efficiently
  * Implement pagination for content lists
  * Use Firebase indexes for better query performance
  * Plan for content delivery optimization

* **Testing:**
  * Unit tests for core functionality
  * Integration tests for Firebase interactions
  * E2E tests for critical user flows
  * Performance testing for audio playback

* **Monitoring:**
  * Implement error tracking
  * Add usage analytics
  * Monitor authentication flows
  * Track performance metrics

**Future Enhancements:**

* Apple Health / Google Fit integration
* Guided breathing exercises
* Group meditation sessions
* Custom meditation timer
